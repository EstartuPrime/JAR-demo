# JAR-demo
Test-repository for the JAR Project. This is to test the correct project setup for each developer.

Before checkout create a new Pololu A-Start 32U4 project with the PlatformIO extension of Visual Studio Code:
![Add new Pololu A-Star 32U4 project](./media/create_new_pololu_project.gif "Add new Pololu A-Star 32U4 project")

Locate the project folder and then clone this repository into that folder.  

This is to enshure that all local dependencies in the project has the correct setup. PlatformIO genereates a .gitignore file where all local settings are inside.

The project folder looks now like this:  
![project folder after gitclone](./media/after_gitclone.png "Project folder after gitclone.")
